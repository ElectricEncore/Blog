            <h5>The Most Psycho EHead Goes to Nationals: An Insight Into Deathhead</h5>

            <p>Throughout the course of the mha ccg, EraserHead has stayed a very reliable character in terms of competitive play. More importantly to me though, he has become my pet character. Back when I was a cute little mha player who just started the game, playing Mei Hatsume, I saw Alliteration Gaming’s (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@alliterationgaming">https://www.youtube.com/@alliterationgaming</a>) EraserHead deck techs, and told myself when I was big and strong, I would play a 7 hander without losing 19 health instantly.
            </p>
            <p>Almost one year later, my Mei list has been left behind and my enjoyment for EraserHead withstood what I deem the “Sir Nighteye Crisis.” In that time EraserHead has changed though. From the all symbol punches package some deemed the “Ojiro Killer,” to void kicks, that in my experience, just felt like randomly popped off, a list has set itself apart to become “the set 5 Eraser list of all time.” With the release of Repeated 100% Smash in Undaunted Raid, void punches has been the way to go with Eraser Head.
            </p>

            <p>Repeated 100% is one of the most flexible, if not the most flexible attack in the game right now. Readying up foundations at this rate can do so many things, from keeping up foundations for your opponent's turn, to readying the cards needed for that big attack to end the game. Not to mention its ex and powerful 3, allowing it to become a threat in itself.
            </p>
            <p>So If I wanted to play EraserHead at nationals, I should have brought void, right? You think the answer for me would be yes, but that is where you would be mistaken. But what would make you ditch repeated 100%? Is there some exciting card on a different symbol that I deemed capable of performing better in nationals? Was there a list that I’ve been refining for months that I was ready to showcase? Nope, I was just too poor! At one point I was very lost on what to bring to nationals. But a hero would answer my call. A certain Jose Norono would win the webcam regional on the death symbol. Since that regional I have been playing the deck and changing it to become my own.

            <div class="Caption"><p>My List</p></div>
            <p>The death list allows EraserHead to produce giant strings with cards that all affect his checks or difficulty.  Twisting azure provides a +1 to checks, and instant shining flash and binding cloth capture allow a subtraction in difficulty. Combined with the card draw of vile  seizing, huge strings all on a 4 or 5 are very possible.
            </p>
            <p>Jose’s list, and many other lists rely on fierce whirlwind. Fierce whirlwind, much like repeated 100%, allows the readying of cards to go farther into strings. With a grenadier bracers on stage, it can also become a ginormous threat, for the cost of your stage. The card can work very well, however in my experiences, it felt like a dead card. Without hard to find bracers, the attack was not a threat, and not many cards needed to be readied when you had so much going against progressive difficulty. This inspired my changes to the list.
            </p>
            <p>To get rid of fierce whirlwind, and to increase the consistency of that explosive kill turn, I cut the list to 50 cards. The 4 core attacks stayed, with the addition of a foresight fusillade to round off the number of attacks.
            </p>
            <p>The foundations also changed mostly due to the absence of fierce whirlwind. Blood evaluation and enamored were cut due to losing the ability to ready foundations, and the 1 of’s were cut to make way for more defensive cards. Foresight is a great card to play at the end of a turn to know your check for that first vital breaker block. Finally, arrogant disposition was a great add for all the punch decks running around.
            </p>
            <p>Brute strength, tight lipped, red riot’s the coolest, and learning to harden, are the undeniable foundations of this deck. They provide the damage necessary for not only twisting azure inferno, but the damage for making these strings hurt. Erase is also a great way to provide damage to twisting azure inferno.
            </p>
            <p>The sideboard was also changed for mostly defensive pieces, which could be used to adapt the deck when needed.  Detailing the plans are anti throw, they aren’t needed very much, but when you need them you NEED them. Arrogant dispositions are in the side for the same reason they are in the main, punches are just everywhere. I had forcing surrender in the board to discard it before a Tabe could remove it, as I was practicing a lot of them. In hindsight, I would replace it with a copy of food, to help in the 2 ehead matchup. Nightwatch is there to cancel big enhances, such as repeated 100% or maximum overhauls enhances. Finally, Sports festival champ is just the greatest card in this sideboard. Are you dealing with Mirios? Tamakis? Anything that says twisting azure inferno isn’t 7 damage. Not anymore! The only issue with it was that I somehow didn’t play a Mirio the entire weekend.
            </p>
            <p>Overall, this aggro deck on a control character has been very fun and I had so much fun with it at nationals. I understand it’s not exactly the most original deck, but I couldn’t help but highlight the deck that I now enjoy so much. My next article about a deck should be more original, at the very least not almost ripped from a regional list.
            </p>
            <p>I also understand that this article was probably kind of, if not very flawed. This website is a personal project for me in a lot of ways. I’m getting back into web development by developing the website myself, and I haven’t written an article for something not school required since I was in the newspaper club in 7th grade. Huge shoutout to Jose, for showing the deck off to me at the finals of the webcam regional, Pippa for her articles that inspired me to write my own (<a href="https://www.pippathink.com">https://www.pippathink.com</a>), and Alliteration Gaming for getting me to find my love for EraserHead!
